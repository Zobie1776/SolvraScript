NovaOS




Welcome to NovaOS — a modular, AI-native, developer-first operating system for creators, engineers, hackers, and forward-thinkers.



🚀 What is NovaOS?

NovaOS is a hybrid custom operating system designed from the ground up to:

Empower developers and creators with full system control

Embed AI and automation into every layer of the OS

Enable rapid application scripting via NovaScript

Be modular, customizable, and quantum/AI/crypto-ready

Whether you're building apps, training AI models, automating your environment, or designing a new UI — NovaOS gives you the tools and the canvas.



🎯 Who is NovaOS For?

Indie developers & open-source contributors

System hackers & Linux power users

Game designers & digital artists

AI/ML engineers & data scientists

Self-hosting & privacy enthusiasts

Futurists building new paradigms



🔧 Key Technologies

NovaScript — a custom scripting language for system automation and app control

NovaCore — the virtual machine + bytecode execution engine

NovaShell — the custom GUI shell replacing GNOME/KDE

NovaIDE — an integrated development environment for NovaScript/Rust

NovaPlayOS — a game/media launcher for immersive console mode

NovaAppStore — a decentralized app store with crypto/NFT support

NovaAI + HiveMind — integrated AI assistants and agent mesh network for collaborative intelligence



🧪 Current Build Strategy

NovaOS is being built in two major forms:

NovaLinux (Hybrid Dev Environment)A minimal Ubuntu Linux base with all NovaOS applications layered on top. Best for developers who want to test-drive NovaOS now.

NovaOS (Standalone ISO)The eventual full custom OS with bootloader, shell, runtime, and apps — no external dependencies. Built from scratch and exported as a bootable ISO.

📦 How to Install (NovaLinux Dev Version)

# 1. Clone the NovaOS repository
git clone https://github.com/yourname/NovaOS.git
cd NovaOS

# 2. Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv novaai-env
source novaai-env/bin/activate

# 3. Install core libraries and tools
sudo pacman -Syu git base-devel rust gtk3 qt6 python-pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Compile NovaScript tokenizer + parser
cd NovaScript
cargo build --release

# 5. Run NovaShell
cd ../NovaShell
cargo run

Note: Each app will have its own folder, build process, and dependencies. Future scripts will automate this.

🤖 NovaAI + HiveMind Collaboration

NovaAI is your personal assistant, code copilot, and automation partner.

Features:

Built-in voice and text interaction

Works inside NovaIDE, Shell, and PlayOS

Can help write code, run commands, or suggest improvements

HiveMind is a distributed collaboration system where users can:

Share anonymized learnings across systems

Opt into AI model collaboration

Work together on code, designs, and simulations with NovaAI instances across the network

Set personal encryption and permissions to protect private data

Future updates will include encrypted AI memory, federated learning, and opt-in global datasets.
