# Nova GUI

Nova GUI delivers the smithay-based Nova Shell compositor, iced launcher and settings apps, a shared theme pipeline, optional wasm plugins, and the `novactl` CLI. The workspace targets smithay 0.7 (EGL/Glow) and iced 0.13.1 with strict pinning so builds remain reproducible both online and offline (via the optional `offline` feature).
