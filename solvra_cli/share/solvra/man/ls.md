# ls

## Synopsis
`ls [OPTIONS] [PATH]`

## Description
Lists directory contents. SolvraCLI delegates to the system `ls` implementation, so options are forwarded to the host platform utility.

## Examples
- `ls` — list files in the current directory.
- `ls -la /tmp` — show a detailed listing of `/tmp`.
