# Solvra Shell

> This directory hosts the original Rust shell implementation (v0.1.0 lineage).

Solvra Shell is a Wayland desktop environment tailored to SolvraOS and Solvra Lite. The workspace is designed around a smithay compositor core, iced-based launcher and settings applications, a theme engine, and a wasm-friendly plugin surface. This repository provides the vertical slice needed to experiment with layouts, JSON-RPC control, and theming while leaving room for future extensions such as tablet gestures and plugin sandboxes.
